## ✨ Key Features & Learning Outcomes

Explore and learn about:

* **Experiment Tracking:** Log model parameters, metrics, and artifacts for comprehensive experiment management using `mlflow.log_param`, `mlflow.log_metric`, and `mlflow.log_artifact`.
* **Model Versioning & Registration:** Utilize the MLflow Model Registry to version, manage, and promote models through different stages (e.g., Staging to Production).
* **Model Lifecycle Management:** Understand how to transition models within the registry and load specific versions for inference.
* **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Practical examples demonstrating techniques like SMOTETomeK for addressing class imbalance in binary classification.
* **Structured ML Code:** See how to organize ML code into reusable classes for better maintainability and scalability (`mlops using class.py`).
* **Model Evaluation:** Capture and log detailed performance metrics, including classification reports and confusion matrices.
* **Reproducible ML Pipelines:** Establish practices that ensure consistent and reliable model development and deployment.

## 🎯 MLOps Workflow Highlights

This project demonstrates the practical application of several MLOps responsibilities:

* **Experiment Management:** Systematically logging and comparing different model runs and configurations.
* **Model Development & Iteration:** Rapidly training and evaluating various models with different techniques (e.g., handling imbalanced data).
* **Model Governance:** Centralizing model versions and metadata in a registry for better control and auditability.
* **Model Deployment Readiness:** Preparing models for production by registering them and understanding transition stages.
* **Reproducibility:** Ensuring that any experiment or model can be recreated and validated.
